            You are my church, you are my place of worship <br>
            I heard you're the plug, can I be the circuit? <br>
            When I got court, I hope that you're the verdict <br>
            When you're around, my insides turn inverted
        </p>
        <p>
            My blood start to rush when I see you, doorman <br>
            I know you're nearby and I know your purpose <br>
            Take one look at you, you're heavens incarnate <br>
            What is this spell, baby? Please show some mercy

            Melting like an ice cream when you smile <br>

            I pray that I can learn to be funny <br>
            I am watching every stand-up comedy <br>
            Just hoping that it will rub off on me <br>
            So you'll smile at everything I say
        </p>
        <p>
            You got some soft lips and some pearly whites (pearly whites) <br>
            I wanna touch them in the dead of night (dead of night) <br>
            Your smile ignites just like a candlelight (candlelight) <br>
            Then somehow I know everything's alright
